Checkmk consulting: Check if count of powersupplies is greater 2

If you are interested if Count of power supplies is greater 2
and you send me an agent output of e.g. one of the UCS Management Boards that contains Services for the power supplies,
I can show you how to set up a simple active check to count them.

Only if you are interested.


This is how to download the agent output:
