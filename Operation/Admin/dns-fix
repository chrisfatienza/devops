Stop auto adding DNS entries 
Copilot
Certainly! To disable automatic DNS updates during the realm join process, you can follow these steps:
1. Edit sssd.conf:
• First, ensure that you’ve joined the realm using realmd.
• Locate your sssd.conf file (usually located at /etc/sssd/sssd.conf).
• Remove the existing sssd.conf file (make sure to back it up first).
• Create a new override file in the directory /etc/sssd/conf.d/. You can name it something like 01-mydomain.conf.
• Set the ownership and permissions of this file to match those of sssd.conf (usually root:root with permissions 600).
• In the override file, add the following section:
[domain/ad.example.com]
dyndns_update = false

Replace ad.example.com with your actual domain name.
2. Re-Join the Realm:
• Re-join the realm using realmd.
• The newly generated sssd.conf will include the specified override settings.
• These settings will suppress dynamic DNS updates during the realm join process.
 

3. Note on Overrides:
• sssd reads and applies configuration from files in the conf.d directory in sort order.
• Overrides in this directory take precedence over the main sssd.conf.
• Remember that the override files won’t be included in the main sssd.conf, so you’ll need to look for them specifically in the conf.d directory1.
By following these steps, you should be able to disable dynamic DNS updates during the realm join process effectively.
